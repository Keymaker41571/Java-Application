Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming. Many problems that can be solved with iteration or loops can also be
solved with recursion. Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself (it has its own method name at the inside
and end of the method). Recursion is slower that loops because it utilizes stack frames however it benefits from multiple
function calls. To write a recursive function you need three pieces of information, identify/break down problem, find out 
base case, what to put into the recursive call at the end of the method.

Lamba expressions are part of the functional interface in Java, they provide a faster more efficient way to write code. You create a functional 
interface which at most has one abstract method, but can have many default or static methods. You use the object of the interface to write a 
lamba function which doesnt not have declaration, may or may not have a return type, and has no access modifier. It helps to write methods of 
an instance of a class more close knitted. Java has four predefined lamba classes Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier ---> java.util.function

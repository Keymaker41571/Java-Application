Polymorphism - the ability for an object to have many forms. One of the four pillars of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is polymorphism, 
it should also be noted that inheritance is also one of the four pillars of OOP and is required in order for polymorphism to occur.
One analogy that can be considered is parent class Animal and its subclasses fish, bear, pig. They all use class animal but have their own
implementation, we can use a single action in different ways.
